## Notes
* Initially designed for iPad resolution (XGA).
* Will scale down OK but needs a lot of detail work to provide a reasonable experience.

## Limitations
* It's a bit flaky.

## To do
* Add deletion functionality.
* Add event handler to close picker with a click anywhere
* Prevent note body receiving focus when picker open.
* Fix scrolling with long lists of notes.
* Attend to issues with use of local storage.
* Get offline mode working.
